Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within an HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. Holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. \r\n\r\nYou can book as far as 13 months out.\r\n\r\n*If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.\r\n\r\nIf you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)\r\n\r\nI have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.\r\n\r\nAlmost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.\r\n\r\nSadly, the resorts do not allow pets.\r\n\r\nWifi is 4.95/day or 15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.\r\n\r\nThis is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. They'll even give you a present if you say yes! Saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. BE SMART - SAY NO - GO ENJOY YOUR VACATION! :)\r\n\r\nWe've had too many bad experiences with guests from Orange County, California. If you are a current or former resident of Orange County and would like to rent from us, kindly be kind in your messages; we'll get the hint that you're a decent person and will welcome you with open arms.\r\n\r\n***Feel good about your vacation!

Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within an HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. Holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. \r\n\r\nYou can book as far as 13 months out.\r\n\r\n*If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.\r\n\r\nIf you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)\r\n\r\nI have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.\r\n\r\nAlmost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.\r\n\r\nSadly, the resorts do not allow pets.\r\n\r\nWifi is 4.95/day or 15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.\r\n\r\nThis is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. They'll even give you a present if you say yes! Saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. BE SMART - SAY NO - GO ENJOY YOUR VACATION! :)\r\n\r\nWe've had too many bad experiences with guests from Orange County, California. If you are a current or former resident of Orange County and would like to rent from us, kindly be kind in your messages; we'll get the hint that you're a decent person and will welcome you with open arms.\r\n\r\n***Feel good about your vacation!

But it's only a half a block away from the best shops and restaurants as you make the three block walk to the beach. There's an elementary school across the street so you may hear kids playing during the day but most of the time you won't notice its there.  Ocean Beach also sits close to the San Diego airport which means you can hear some of the louder planes that fly overhead. The airport has a curfew starting at 11:30pm at night and ending at 6:30am in the morning so light sleepers will likely hear the first flights in the morning. Most people aren't bothered by the airplanes and the cottage has double pane windows to keep things pretty quiet inside.", "notes": "As mentioned before, Ocean Beach sits close to the San Diego airport which means light  sleepers will likely hear the first flights in the morning beginning at 6:30am.  Also, the front house is home to our friends/tenants who have a friendly chihuahua/daschund who stays inside most of the day and doesn't bark much. You may meet her in the front yard if she comes out to play so please be mindful to keep the front gate closed. The back courtyard gate will keep her out of your way if you so choose.    Our Transient Occupancy certificate number is #610821.", "transit": "Ocean Beach is a small beach town and the cottage is centrally located to be able to walk to all the best restaurants, shops and most importantly the beach.  There are a couple bus lines a block away that can take you downtown or to other parts of San Diego, but the public transportation in San Diego isn't the most convenient.  The airport is very convenient by taxi. Another cool option that we like is Car2Go which offers a very convenient car sharing program for short trips to downtown or nearby sites, although this requires a little pre-planning because you have to sign up for a membership ahead of time if you don't already have one.  We also have a couple older beach cruiser bicycles that are available upon request.", "access": "After passing through the front yard and walkway of the front house, you'll enter your own gated courtyard and find the red door of our back cottage. Keyless entry lock so you won't have to worry about keys, we'll give you your own code. Behind the cottage is a garage which we use for storage and laundry but you'll also find a hot/cold outdoor shower for a refreshing rinse after the beach. There's also alley access behind the garage if you don't want to walk past the front house. Feel free to park in the parking spot behind the garage since finding parking on the street can sometimes be difficult. The entire property is surrounded by a wooden fence for privacy and security.", "interaction": "We're happy to provide any level of interaction you prefer.

I'm who you'll speak with on the phone or communicate with via text/email. I love to laugh (and embarrassingly do so in totally inappropriate situations), make stupid jokes, eat chips and salsa, listen to jazz, escape into a good book, and hang out with my husband, Brent, and my three dogs: Bella, Trixie, and Mikey. You'll never find me without dog hair on my clothes, I've learned not to fight it any longer. My favorite quote is by Jack Kerouac \"Be in love with your life - every minute of it\".\r\n\r\nI've got 15+ years experience in residential and commercial real estate management (which makes me sound really old) an MA in Literature and Writing Studies; I've been licensed as a Realtor\u00ae for almost 20 years and as a Real Estate Broker for over 10 years. And, because I like to always be learning, also hold the designations of GRI\u00ae (Graduate Real Estate Institute), RMS\u00ae (Risk Management Specialist), and ePro\u00ae (Real Estate Technology Specialist). \r\n\r\nPSG is family owned and operated.  We believe in treating every home we manage with a personal touch, as if it's our own, and treating every guest who stays with us as a welcome friend.

Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within an HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. Holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. \r\n\r\nYou can book as far as 13 months out.\r\n\r\n*If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.\r\n\r\nIf you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)\r\n\r\nI have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.\r\n\r\nAlmost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.\r\n\r\nSadly, the resorts do not allow pets.\r\n\r\nWifi is 4.95/day or 15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.\r\n\r\nThis is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare.

Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within an HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. Holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. \r\n\r\nYou can book as far as 13 months out.\r\n\r\n*If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.\r\n\r\nIf you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)\r\n\r\nI have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.\r\n\r\nAlmost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.\r\n\r\nSadly, the resorts do not allow pets.\r\n\r\nWifi is 4.95/day or 15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.\r\n\r\nThis is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. They'll even give you a present if you say yes! Saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. BE SMART - SAY NO - GO ENJOY YOUR VACATION! :)\r\n\r\nWe've had too many bad experiences with guests from Orange County, California.
